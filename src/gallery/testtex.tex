    \section*{Problem}

    \section*{Approach}
    The solution is as following:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Sort the list of Picassos and list of Dalis by increasing order of price and then increasing order of size.
        \item Now create a map for every Picasso where the key is the Picasso itself and the value is the collection of Dalis that can be placed behind it and fulfill the rules.
        \item Now find the longest subsection (moving window algorithm) of consecutive Picassos that have at least one (exclusive and unique) Dali that corresponds to them.
    \end{enumerate}
    \section*{Pseudo-code}
    \begin{verbatim}
procedure SORT(list): [O(nlogn)]
    Run an O(nlogn) sort on the list with the following conditions:
        1. Firstly, sort the elements in the list according to their
           prices (increasing).
        2. Next, sort all the elements in the list with the same
           price by size (increasing).

function TO-MAP(Picassos,Dalis): [O(n²)]
    precondition: the Picassos and Dalis must be sorted.
    resultMap ← a map implementation where the order is preserved.
    (Eg: SortedMap in Java and dict in Python.)
    for each Picasso in Picassos:
        add the Picasso as a key to resultMap and initialize the keys
        as an empty list.
        for each Dali in Dalis:
            if size of Picasso < size of Dali:
                add the Dali to the corresponding list for this Picasso.
    return resultMap

function AUCTION(Picassos,Dalis): [O(n²)]
    SORT(Picassos)
    SORT(Dalis)
    gallery←TO-MAP(Picassos,Dalis)
    i, cur, max, iMax, jMax ← 0
    j ← 1
    for each curPicasso in keys(gallery):
        for each subsequent nextPicasso in keys(gallery):
            if (length of list of Dalis corresponding to nextPicasso
                > length of list of Dalis corresponding to curPicasso + cur):
                j ← j + 1
                cur ← j - i
                if cur > max:
                    iMax ← i
                    jMax ← j
                    max ← cur
                else:
                    j ← j + 1
            else:
                i ← i + 1
                j ← j + 1
    return a new gallery as a section of the original gallery from iMax to jMax
